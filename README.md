- 👋 Hi, I’m @LadnarofLadner
- 👀 I’m interested in (0) Strong AI, and gustatory and olfactory transducer design (SAW and FOIC massively parallel arrays, or possibly solid state, standard silicon, preferred),  (1) Technopoly, a board game I have partially constructed, and currently "beta-test" the mathematics for improved rules. (2)  A Python, pygames, version of that game, repository seen here on git-hub. (3) Possibly an Android version.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some old 6502 assembly, and Python. And probably C, at some point. Bash/Ash shell scripting. Hex dumps and fundamentals of code structure for all commonly used files, bmps, jpgs, mp4s, mkv, wav, mp3, ASCII, txt, etc....
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Strong A.I. I have developed much of the technical theory required, though much needs to be done in the area of implementation. Theory includes (0) Meyer's Law (combinatorial Lingusitic equation), (1) Meyer's Eye Approximation (Some simplifications about human and computer vision), and (2) MSSAID, or Meyer's Strong Artificial Intelligence Standard Directories, an extension to the LSB (Linux Standard Base), and the FHS (Filesystem Hierachy Standard).
- 📫 How to reach me, used to be randallmeyer2000@yahoo.com, but now it just fills with SPAM. Try snail mail, first. If I like you we'll exchange phone numbers.
